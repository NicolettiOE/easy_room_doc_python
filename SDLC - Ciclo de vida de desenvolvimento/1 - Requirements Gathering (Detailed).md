### 1.1 Functional Requirements

These requirements describe what the system must do, focusing on the features and functionalities that will be implemented. Here’s a breakdown for a hotel booking platform using **React** for the front-end and **Python** for the back-end:

**User Registration and Authentication**

- Users (both customers and hotel administrators) must be able to create accounts.
- Password recovery features (password resets).

**Hotel and Room Management (Administrator only)**

- Administrators must be able to add new hotels, rooms, and amenities through a management panel.
- Each hotel entry must include:
    - Hotel name, location, contact information, and description.
    - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, breakfast, pool, etc.).
    - Room types and availability (single, double, suite, etc.).
    - Prices for each room type based on the season.
    - Images of the hotel and rooms.
- Administrators must manage room availability and modify details (edit or delete).

**Search Functionality**

- Users must be able to search for hotels based on various filters:
    - Location (city, country, etc.).
    - Price range.
    - Date range (check-in and check-out).
    - Room type or amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, breakfast, etc.).
- Search results must be sortable (e.g., by price, rating, distance).

**Hotel/Room Details**

- Users must be able to view detailed pages for each hotel/room, including:
    - Images of the hotel and rooms.
    - Descriptions, amenities, and room prices.
    - Customer reviews and ratings (optional).
    - Availability calendar for bookings.

**Booking System**

- Users must be able to select dates and book available rooms.
- The system must verify room availability and prevent double bookings.
- The platform must display the total price based on selected dates and number of guests.
- Users must receive a confirmation email with booking details.
- Administrators must be able to view and manage bookings (approve/cancel).

**Payment Gateway Integration**

- Users must be able to securely pay for bookings using payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
- Support for various payment methods (credit card, debit card, etc.).
- Ensure transaction security (SSL, PCI compliance).
- Option to save payment methods for future bookings.

**User Profile and Booking History**

- Users must have access to their profiles where they can view and update personal information.
- Users must be able to view previous and upcoming bookings.
- Option to cancel or modify future bookings according to hotel policies.

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements focus on the system’s behavior and characteristics, essential to ensuring a high-quality user experience, security, and scalability.

**Security**

- Authentication: Implement secure authentication using JWT tokens for session management.
- Encryption: Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data like passwords and payment information.
- Role-based access control: Ensure that only administrators can access hotel and room management features, while regular users can only book rooms and manage profiles.
- Data privacy: Comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

**Scalability**

- Ensure the platform can scale to accommodate growth in users, hotels, and bookings without performance degradation.
- Use a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and cloud infrastructure to expand the system as needed.

**Performance**

- The system should load quickly, with minimal response times for searches and bookings.
- Optimize the API to reduce response times, especially during high demand.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data, such as search results.

**Usability**

- The interface must be intuitive, mobile-friendly, and accessible to all users.
- Ensure compatibility across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- Provide clear feedback and error messages (e.g., when a room is unavailable or payment fails).

**Reliability and Availability**

- Aim for 99.9% uptime, with monitoring and alerts to quickly resolve issues.
- Implement database backups and recovery plans to prevent data loss in case of failure.
- Use distributed cloud infrastructure to minimize downtime.

**Maintainability**

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code to facilitate future maintenance and updates.
- Use version control (Git) and continuous integration (CI/CD).
- Ensure the system is testable, with automated tests for both front-end and back-end.

**Compliance**

- Ensure compliance with local and international regulations, such as GDPR and PCI-DSS for payment processing.

### 1.3 Technologies to Support the Requirements

**Front-end: React**

- **React** will handle the user interface. Key libraries and tools include:
    - **React Router** for page navigation.
    - **Redux** or **Context API** for state management.
    - **Axios** or **Fetch** for making HTTP requests to the back-end.
    - **Bootstrap** or **Material UI** for consistent interface design.

**Back-end: Python**

- **Python** will handle the business logic, and key components will include:
    - **Flask** or **Django** for building RESTful APIs.
    - **SQLAlchemy** or **Django ORM** for database interactions.
    - **JWT** for secure authentication and role-based access control.

**Database**

- Use **PostgreSQL** or another relational database to store structured data such as users, hotels, rooms, and bookings.

**Cloud and Hosting**

- Use cloud platforms like **AWS** or **Azure** for deploying the front-end (React) and back-end (Python).
- Consider using containers with **Docker** to facilitate scalability and manage development and production environments.
