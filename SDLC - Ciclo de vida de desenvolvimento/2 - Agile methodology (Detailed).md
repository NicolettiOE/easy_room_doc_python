### **Step 1: Form the Agile Team**

**Team Composition:**

- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines and prioritizes the features of the reservation platform, such as room search pages and the payment system.
- **Scrum Master:** Ensures the team follows Agile principles and resolves any blockers.
- **Front-end Developers (React):** Responsible for creating the interactive and responsive interface. They must ensure React provides a smooth and accessible user experience, focusing on performance and intuitive design.
- **Back-end Developers (Python):** Create APIs and all business logic using frameworks like Flask or Django to manage reservations, authentication, and transactions.
- **Testers (QA):** Create and run automated tests (for example, using Selenium for the front-end in React and pytest for the back-end in Python).
- **UX/UI Designers:** Improve the user experience by creating user-friendly and mobile-optimized interfaces.
- **DevOps:** Sets up CI/CD pipelines and ensures continuous integration, using tools like Jenkins, Docker, or Kubernetes.

### **Step 2: Manage the Backlog**

**Create the Product Backlog:**

- The PO should list essential features such as:
    - Room availability search.
    - User authentication system.
    - Online payment module.
    - Integration with the reservation and customer database.

**Backlog Refinement:**

- Stories should be detailed and broken down into smaller tasks for React (components) and Python (endpoints and logic).
- Prioritization is based on direct system impact, starting with essential features like the booking process and authentication.

### **Step 3: Create User Stories**

Each feature is described as a **user story**:

- "As a customer, I want to search for available rooms so I can choose one based on my preferences."
- "As a customer, I want to make a reservation to ensure the room is available."
- "As an admin, I want to view all reservations to manage availability."

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The search page displays available rooms based on the entered dates.
- The system confirms the reservation after successful payment.

### **Step 4: Sprint Planning**

- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks is a good option to start with, allowing for quick adjustments.
- **Planning:** The PO presents the most important stories (such as room search and reservation). The team selects the ones they can deliver in the sprint.
- **Estimates:** The team will estimate the stories using methods like story points or Planning Poker.

### **Step 5: Sprint Execution and Review**

- **Daily Stand-ups:** Track the progress of React and Python tasks. The team shares what they did, what they will do, and any blockers.
- **Task Board:** Use tools like Jira or Trello to manage the workflow. Columns can include: To Do, In Progress (with separation between front-end and back-end), In Code Review, Done.
- **Sprint Review:** Present the developed features to the PO and stakeholders. The React interface iteration can be validated by the end-user, and the Python API can be tested with real data.

### **Step 6: Retrospective and Continuous Improvement**

- **Retrospective:** After each sprint, discuss improvements. For example, how communication between React and Python developers can be optimized or if the automated tests were sufficient.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Adjust processes based on feedback, both internal and external.

### **Step 7: Project Monitoring**

- **Burndown Chart:** Used to monitor sprint progress and predict completion.
- **Backlog Monitoring:** The PO should keep the backlog updated, adjusting priorities as the reservation system development progresses.

### **Step 8: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** With every commit, React and Python code is integrated into the main repository. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI are configured to run tests automatically.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Code should always be ready for production, with the pipeline set for quick and automated deployment.
- **Automated Tests:** Unit and integration tests for both front-end and back-end ensure application stability. For React, use Jest and React Testing Library. For Python, pytest and integration tests with APIs.

### **Step 9: Launch and Feedback**

- **Frequent Releases:** With each iteration, new features are released. Agile integration between React and the Python API should allow for small but regular releases.
- **User Feedback:** Collect feedback through Google Analytics and surveys to make adjustments as users interact with the reservation platform.
